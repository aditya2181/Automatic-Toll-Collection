# Number-Plate-Detection
Use of OCR libraries and ANPR cameras.
ANPR is Auto Number Plate Detection and OCR is Optimal character Recognition.
For doing this we have input some images of car's.
Then we reading the images in grayscale (i.e. black and white) and blur.
Then applying filters and finding edges for localization.
Then we will find contours and applying masks.
By applying mask we will get the whole car image as black except the number plate which will be highlighted.
Now we will crop this image and apply OCR to read text and we will finally get the results.
With the help of this technology we are able to find the day, time and location as well as the speed of the car.
This technique also helps in finding theft car's and wrong number plate car's.
It also tells us car manufacturer company, it's model and it's colour.
It also help's us in finding the age of the car.
